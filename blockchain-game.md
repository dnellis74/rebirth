# Unnamed Blockchain game
I really wants to build a game.  I'd also like to leverage block chain for both the pool of collaborators, and the potential audience.  At this point I have more ideas about the architecture than the theme so I'll describe the two separately.

## Architecture
* The back end for the game will be an API based that's an "onchain API"
* Sky Strife architecture will have many parallels

  * [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjNpUlmVFfo)
* Example of "API games"
  * https://spacetraders.io/
  * https://www.rubbled.io/
* Example of blockchain platform for API
  * https://www.orbs.com/execution-services/
* Single player experience
  * There will be an AI, maybe a campaign.
* UI
  * A modest UI will be provided.
  * A market could exist for upgraded UI assets, or different architecture.   
## Theme
* This is an "army builder".   Could be medieval, modern, or space fleets
* At the simple level you build armies from a set of units.
* At an advanced level you can build your own units
