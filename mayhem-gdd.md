**Game Title**: Microservice Mayhem (working title)

---

## 1. High-Level Concept

**Elevator Pitch**: A real-time, browser-based factory-style automation sim where you architect and optimize an e-commerce service pipeline. Process customer requests—orders, searches, cancellations—by wiring together components, message queues, caches, and TLS-secured channels. Choose between a flexible microservices architecture or a consolidated monolithic service. Balance throughput, latency, errors, and security to meet SLAs under dynamic load.

**Genre**: Automation / Factory Simulation meets Enterprise Systems Simulator.

**Platform**: Modern Web Browser (desktop & mobile-responsive).

**Target Audience**: Tech-savvy players who enjoy moderate-complexity optimization puzzles and systems design; fans of Factorio, Shapez, and enterprise-themed simulations.

## 2. Key Features

- **Architecture Choice**: Design as many small microservices or a single monolithic service node.  
- **Browser-Native Pipeline Editor**: Drag-and-drop service components (`auth`, `inventory`, `payment`, etc.) and connect them via conveyors, message buses, or TLS-secured links.  
- **Security & Threats**: Implement firewalls, encryption, and intrusion detection. Defend against hacker events that attempt to intercept or tamper with requests and data.  
- **Multiple Queue Types**: Support for FIFO queues, priority queues, and dead-letter queues.  
- **Real-Time Metrics & Dashboard**: Live RPS, latency, error rates, security incidents, and cost per request visualized in an appealing, cartoonish UI.  
- **Scaling & Upgrades**: Allocate CPU, memory, add replicas, integrate caches or CDNs to handle spikes.  
- **Failure Handling Mechanisms**: Retry policies, circuit breakers, TLS handshake failures, and fallback services.  
- **Dynamic Load & Attack Events**: Simulate flash sales, DDoS attacks, network latency spikes, and targeted hacking attempts.  
- **Free-to-Play Model**: Base game is free, with optional cosmetic upgrades (skins, themes, UI decals).

## 3. Gameplay & Mechanics

### 3.1 Core Loop
1. **Plan**: Choose your architectural style (microservices or monolith), establish security measures, and analyze incoming request patterns.  
2. **Build**: Place nodes, configure queue types, secure channels (TLS, encryption modules), and connect them into a pipeline.  
3. **Harden**: Deploy firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and encryption layers at critical points.  
4. **Monitor**: Observe a cartoonish dashboard for performance, resource usage, security alerts, and errors.  
5. **Optimize**: Tweak resource allocations, introduce caches, switch queue types, or consolidate nodes.  
6. **Respond**: Detect and mitigate hacking events—reroute traffic, isolate compromised services, or patch vulnerabilities in real-time.  
7. **Scale**: Add or remove replicas or expand your monolith in real-time to meet SLAs and maintain security postures.  
8. **Advance**: Achieve level goals (e.g., sustain 500 RPS under 150ms latency with <1% errors and zero data breaches).  

### 3.2 Level Progression
- **Mini-Tutorial**: Introduces basic pipeline creation, node configuration, and a simple security setup.  
- **Progressive Complexity**: Unlock TLS links, priority queues, circuit breakers, caching, architectural refactoring, and advanced security modules (IDS, firewalls, encryption keys).  
- **Sandbox Mode**: Unlimited resources, no narrative constraints.  

> **Note**: Multiplayer and narrative modes are planned for future expansions but excluded from initial launch.

## 4. User Interface & Experience

- **Cartoonish Art Style**: Friendly, stylized icons and color-coded nodes with playful animations.  
- **Responsive Layout**: Fluid zoomable canvas and adaptive menus for various screen sizes.  
- **Metrics Panel**: Real-time graphs with whimsical design elements (e.g., bouncing charts when thresholds breach), including a security incident tracker.  
- **Inspector**: Pop-up panels to configure node settings (architecture type toggle, TLS, queue type, retry policy, firewall rules).  
- **Event Feed**: Scrollable log of significant system events with humorous notifications for both operational and security events (e.g., “Hacker Bot Detected!”).

## 5. Technical Architecture

- **Web Technology**: HTML5/TypeScript/React frontend, Node.js simulation engine.  
- **Architecture Flexibility**: Engine supports both monolithic service nodes and microservices with simulated inter-service communication.  
- **Security Simulation**: Implement mock TLS handshake, encryption/decryption modules, firewall logic, and intrusion detection algorithms.  
- **Data Definitions**: JSON-driven service, security module, and scenario configurations.  
- **Networking**: Simulated TLS handshake and queue behaviors for authenticity.

## 6. Monetization & Scope

- **Free-to-Play**: Full base game available without charge.  
- **Cosmetic Packs**: Themed UI skins, node icon sets, background music tracks.  
- **Future DLC**: Industry-specific campaigns, narrative expansions, and advanced multiplayer security challenge modes.

## 7. Next Steps & Questions

1. **Cosmetic Themes**: Any specific visual themes or palettes you want initially?  
2. **Security Modules**: Which types of security tools (e.g., WAF, IDS, encryption key management) are most important?  
3. **Tutorial Goals**: Should the mini-tutorial cover basic security concepts or focus solely on pipeline basics?  
4. **Art Direction References**: Any games or styles you prefer for the cartoonish UI?
